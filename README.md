# Static Routing 

This project simulates a multi-router network with end devices and VLAN segmentation using Cisco Packet Tracer.

## 🧩 Components
- 4 Routers (R1–R4)
- Multiple switches and PCs
- Configured IP addressing scheme
- Static Routing
- Inter-network connectivity verified using ping

## 🧠 Learning Objectives
- Subnetting and IP allocation
- Router configuration and troubleshooting
- Network topology design and documentation

## 🛡️ Future Work
- Implement ACLs and VLANs
- Add DHCP and DNS configuration
- Simulate a basic firewall setup



# 🖧 Static Routing 2

This project contains a Packet Tracer simulation with **four LANs** connected through **two routers**, demonstrating inter-network communication.

## 🔹 Network Overview
- **LAN 1:** 192.168.1.0/24  
- **LAN 2:** 192.168.2.0/24  
- **LAN 3:** 192.168.3.0/24  
- **LAN 4:** 192.168.4.0/24  
- **Router Link:** 11.0.0.0/30  

## 🔹 Features
- Correct IP addressing for all devices  
- Static routing between routers
